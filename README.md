# drag-and-drop-HTML5-JavaScript
Several demos about the Drag and Drop effect which have been entirely made through HTML5 and JavaScript.
No additional libraries such as JQuery or Angular.

## Usage
Just download the demo you wish. You don't need to install anything (is just HTML5 and JavaScript code). 
They run from the client side, a common browser is the only needed.

## Customization
Most of the demos requires only to change the style sheet of the HTML elements and then
you just need to add the draggable element in the HTML source page as described in to this [web site] (http://155.94.246.111/DragAndDrop/).
Above all, take care of the name convention of the draggable items, which are basically div elements.
If you have JavaScript skills, you can also try to have a look to the code and then change the behavior of the Drag and Drop effects
as you need in order to achieve your result.

## Browser compatibility
The demos have been successfully tested on the following browsers:
* Google Chrome 41.0
* Firefox 37.0
* Safari 8.0
* Opera 30.0
* IE 11.0

Smartphones/tablets browsers will not run properly (or will not run at all) the expected effect.
HTML5 Drag and Drop does not cover these devices.
